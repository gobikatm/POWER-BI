Global Economic and Demographic Trends Analysis – Explained

Your dashboard summarizes key global indicators by combining economic, demographic, and social data across multiple countries. It uses cards, charts, and filters to provide high-level insights as well as detailed breakdowns.

Top Summary Cards

These four cards at the top provide quick, aggregated global metrics:

Growth Rate — 80.50bn
Represents the total or cumulative growth rate value across all countries.

Median Population — 4.79M
Shows the median population size (in millions) across all nations in the dataset.

Sum of Net Migration — 1.64M
Indicates total net migration (immigrants minus emigrants) across all countries.

Total GDP — 2M
The combined GDP measure (unit depends on dataset—likely millions or billions).

These cards act as global KPIs for the entire dashboard.

1. Infant Mortality Statistics by Country

A line chart shows:

Minimum infant mortality

Maximum infant mortality

Standard deviation

This helps compare how infant mortality varies between countries and how consistent or inconsistent trends are within each one.

Use case: Spot countries with extremely high or variable mortality rates.

2. Donut Chart: Combined Indicators

This donut summarizes four metrics:

Sum of Infant Mortality

Sum of Population Density

Average Population

Max GDP per Capita

It provides an at-a-glance view of how these measures contribute proportionally to overall global totals. For example, population-related metrics form the largest segments.

3. Country Selector Panel

A slicer on the right lists all countries, allowing users to:

Filter the entire dashboard by one or multiple countries

Compare subsets of nations

This is the main interactive control for the report.

4. Average Population & Literacy (by Country and Region)

A bar chart that shows:

Each country grouped by region

Average population and average literacy rate

Color-coded bars represent different world regions such as:

East Asia

Europe & Central Asia

Latin America

North America

Middle East, etc.

Insight: Large countries like China and India dominate population averages, while literacy varies significantly by region.

5. Count of Countries by Income Group

A vertical bar chart summarizing how many countries fall into each World Bank income classification:

Low income

Lower middle income

Upper middle income

High income

Purpose: Helps understand the distribution of countries across economic tiers.

6. Sum of Industry by Country

A bar chart ranking countries by their industrial output.

This helps identify high-industrial-output nations (e.g., U.S., China, etc.) and compare smaller economies.
